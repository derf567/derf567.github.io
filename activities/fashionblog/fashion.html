    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week" target="_blank">NYFW</a> can be both amazingly fun & incredibly
        overwhelming, especially if you've never been. Luckily, I'm here to give you an insider's guide and
        make your first show a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips and tricks and following your gut,
        you'll have an unforgettable experience!</p>

        <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>

        <p> you’re lucky or connected, you can get an invite sans the price tag. But I wasn’t so lucky or
            connected my first 2 years so I’m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are the most
            important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you’re worrying
            about blowing your cash the whole time you won’t have fun. Then check out prices, days, a
            times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get
            excited!

    <p>Always be true to your own sense of style. If you don't, you'll be uncomfortable the whole time, and it will show. Remember, NYFW is
        about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their
        new lines. Also, it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously, you want to
        look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>
